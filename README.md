##TV List##

This app keeps track of tv programs all in one place. It allows the user to create and delete a show, add comments, favorite and delete a show. I created it to keep track of the shows I like to watch and those I still need to watch.

It uses React/Redux, as well as Semantic UI React for styling.

The backend is a Rails API. See that repository [here](https://github.com/koberlander/tv-list-backend).
